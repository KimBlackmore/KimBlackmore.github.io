<h1>Kim Blackmore</h1>

I have many years experience as an academic undertaking in mathematical analysis of machine learning and ad hoc network systems, 
with accompanying data science and simulation coding experience. I also have many years experieince using information and 
communcations technologies in higher education, and guiding other academics in how to use education technologies in their teaching.
Now I am updating my web coding skills so that I will be able to develop my own technology solutions to the needs I see around me.
